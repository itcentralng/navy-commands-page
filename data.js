        text: `
        Since inception in 1956, the statutory roles of the NN have expanded to cover the full spectrum of military, policing, and diplomatic functions. So also, were the imperatives of operational capacity that demand effective presence and domain awareness within the internal waters, territorial seas, and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). As part of the structural response to these challenges, the NN had over the past decades operated a two-command structure for the coordination of its operational level activities, namely; Western Naval Command (WNC) and Eastern Naval Command (ENC). while noting that both operational commands have equitably discharged their responsibilities, recent events and indeed the trend of threats within the nation's marital domain have justified the necessity for a review of the current structure. Specifically, the emergence of various forms of illegal trafficking, militancy, sabotage, piracy, and attacks on shipping have placed considerable demand on NN policing capacity, particularly in the Niger Delta. Inevitably, apart from improved coastal presence with ships and bases, there are emergent requirements for more robust capability on riverine and special operations, including the protection of Key Points and Valuable Points.
 \n       
        In consonance with the foregoing realities, the NN besides previous arguments for, and under its ongoing transformation process identified the need for the creation of a third operational command. Therefore, following the recent approval by the Navy Board, this Nigerian Navy Order hereby promulgates the establishment of the Third Operational Command to be known as the Central Naval Command (CNC).
