        text: `
        Since inception in 1956, the statutory roles of the NN have expanded to cover the full spectrum of military, policing, and diplomatic functions. So also, were the imperatives of operational capacity that demand effective presence and domain awareness within the internal waters, territorial seas, and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). As part of the structural response to these challenges, the NN had over the past decades operated a two-command structure for the coordination of its operational level activities, namely; Western Naval Command (WNC) and Eastern Naval Command (ENC). while noting that both operational commands have equitably discharged their responsibilities, recent events and indeed the trend of threats within the nation's marital domain have justified the necessity for a review of the current structure. Specifically, the emergence of various forms of illegal trafficking, militancy, sabotage, piracy, and attacks on shipping have placed considerable demand on NN policing capacity, particularly in the Niger Delta. Inevitably, apart from improved coastal presence with ships and bases, there are emergent requirements for more robust capability on riverine and special operations, including the protection of Key Points and Valuable Points.
 \n       
        In consonance with the foregoing realities, the NN besides previous arguments for, and under its ongoing transformation process identified the need for the creation of a third operational command. Therefore, following the recent approval by the Navy Board, this Nigerian Navy Order hereby promulgates the establishment of the Third Operational Command to be known as the Central Naval Command (CNC).

                Naval doctrine provides the foundation upon which navies are organized, trained, equipped, and deployed. It also sets the basis for assessment and improvement of standards for personnel and equipment, hence the need for emplacement of doctrines for regular assessment of activities and procedures in the Nigerian Navy (NN). To achieve this, efforts were made in the past including the establishment of Naval Training Command, Directorate of Inspection Doctrine and Research, Sea Training Command, and Naval Doctrine and Assessment Centre (NDAC).
\n
                The structure and mandate of NDAC as a field unit showed inherent limitations that impede the center's effectiveness. It is, therefore, imperative for the NN to institute an enduring establishment to formulate and superintend over the implementation of principles, practices, techniques as well as procedures of naval operations, consistent with the NN Doctrine. Accordingly, Navy Board 4 of 2021 approved the establishment of a Doctrine Command with its headquarters to be located at NN's land in Epe, Lagos State, and to take over roles of NDAC, among other responsibilities. In order to give effect to the decision of the Navy Board, this NNO hereby promulgates the establishment of the Command and sets out its modus operandi. The Command shall be known as the Naval Doctrine Command (NAVDOC).

                Over the years, the Nigerian Navy (NN) has separated fleet support services from logistic support services to improve its operational efficiency. As a result, the administrative control of logistics is split between the Maintenance Corps (FMC) and the Logistic Corps. However, challenges in this arrangement have adversely affected the ability to provide adequate logistics support for naval operations. Other limitations of the current logistic system in the NN include a lack of a career profession for a body of well-trained logistics officers and a separation between maintenance and supply of spare parts.
\n
                In order to address these issues and ensure more practical and result-oriented fleet and logistic support for sustained naval operations, there is a need for the NN to adopt an integrated approach. Consequently, to have a functional and efficient response to the military challenges of an ever-expanding scope, the Logistics Command (NNLC) is hereby established. The task of the NNLC is to preserve, maintain, and sustain systems in a state of operational readiness and at minimum cost, consistent with mission requirements.
