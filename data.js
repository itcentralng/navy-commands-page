    text: `Since inception in 1956, the statutory roles of the NN have expanded to cover the
      full   spectrum   of   military,   policing   and   diplomatic   functions.   So   also,   were   the
      imperatives   of   operational   capacity   that   demand   effective   presence   and   domain
      awareness within the internal waters, territorial seas and the Exclusive Economic Zone
      (EEZ). As part of the structural response to these challenges, the NN had over the past
      decades operated a two-command structure for the coordination of its operational level
      activities, namely; Western Naval Command (WNC) and Eastern Naval Command
      (ENC). while noting that both operational commands have equitably discharged their
      responsibilities, recent events and indeed the trend of threats within the nation's marital
      domain have justified the necessity for. review of the current structure. Specifically, the
      emergence of various forms of illegal trafficking, militancy, sabotage. piracy and attacks
      on shipping have placed considerable demand on NN policing capacity, particularly in
      the Niger Delta. Inevitably, apart from improved coastal presence with ships and bases,
      there are emergent requirements for more robust capability on riverine and special
      operations, including the protection of Key Points and Valuable Points.
      
      In consonance with the foregoing realities, the NN besides previous arguments for,
      and under its ongoing transformation process identified the need for the creation of a
      third operational command. Therefore, following the recent approval by the Navy Board,
      this Nigerian Navy Order hereby promulgates the establishment of the Third Operational
      Command to be known as the Central Naval Command (CNC).`,
